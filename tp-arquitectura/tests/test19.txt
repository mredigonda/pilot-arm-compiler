# Hot-cold game:
# v1: number to guess
# v2: number of opportunities
# You have to insert numbers trying to guess v1, the 
# program will output information depending on the 
# numbers you enter, if it is greater than v1, it 
# prints -1, if it is lower than v1, it prints 1,
# and if it is equal, it prints 0 and stops the 
# execution.
# The execution also stops if you have no more shots.
