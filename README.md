# Pilot-ARM Compiler

This is a compiler from a toy programmnig language called Pilot, to ARM assembly. It was developed as the final project for my Computer Architecture class.

You can find the presentation of this project in the file [final-work.pdf](https://github.com/mredigonda/pilot-arm-compiler/blob/master/final-work.pdf) (the problem statement is in [tp_pilot.pdf](https://github.com/mredigonda/pilot-arm-compiler/blob/master/tp_pilot.pdf)).

You can view the documentation using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/):
* Go to folder: `cd src`
* Generate documentation: `doxygen`
* Open the generated docs: `src/html/index.html`
